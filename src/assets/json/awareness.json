Research has shown that eye-gaze tracking enhances user interaction and improves collaborative task performance [NB20]. The most commonly used visual cues for eye-gaze awareness include pointers, rays, and avatars, which help users understand their collaborators' focus. One study [MSKB16] developed a prototype that shares gaze direction using a pointer, facilitated by special glasses. Their user study found that gaze sharing not only improved collaboration but also strengthened the sense of connection among remote participants. Another study [RPM21] explored the use of avatars to enhance real-world movements with subtle redirected gazes, further enriching communication in virtual environments",

Rays, FoV shapes, pointers, and orientation are typical visual cues employed in this face direction awareness. One relevant study [PLI19] presented CoVAR, a novel MR remote collaboration system using AR and VR technology applying eye-gaze (using rays) and head-gaze (rays mixed with FoV shape) input. They discovered that gaze cues are crucial for improving remote collaboration by reducing task load. Further, a group of researchers [FAMR19] implemented a prototype with a ray emanating from the user's head direction. Interestingly, the ray was also useful for selection purposes. In a teleport task, in which one user brings another one into a collaborative jump, orientation cues are used to avoid motion sickness. The investigators [WKF19] developed a window and a compass (orientation cues) to limit jumping based on the navigator's viewing direction. Pointer cues were used in a study showing that sharing head pointers can improve performance, co-presence awareness, and user collaborative experiences [WZB21].",

The mirrored user can snap to another user's head with an independent head orientation and minor control of their head position offset to avoid simulation sickness. Other authors [XHPW18] designed another innovative example of user perspective by manipulating the avatar scale.

It enables users to move long distances virtually when the physical space is smaller than the virtual world. Rays, virtual volume, and ghosting are visual cues that create awareness of teleport intention. A found study [WKF19] investigated the action of teleporting using rays in a collaborative task. They implemented a prototype that allows users to bring another collaborator to a new position by teleporting together. So, they have created three variations of a multi-ray jumping technique, consisting of a secondary ray for the passive user to be aware of the intention to teleport. Otherwise, they would feel disoriented and suffer from motion sickness. Thus, the teleport intention cues are proposed to warn a user that a collaborator will change position and bring this passive user to a new location in the virtual world. One good example of using ghosting and virtual volumes to indicate an intended teleport task from another user was developed by [XHPW18]. Individuals may create and position another user's avatar with different dimensions to create an awareness of the teleport destination for that user. This special avatar is denoted as a parallel avatar and has a ghosting aspect. In addition, passive travelers get a notification with a virtual volume close to their eyes, indicating the intention of another user to communicate in another location. To teleport, users need to select using a controller on this virtual volume and jump to the final destination.",

            "description" : "During collaborative tasks, it can be critical to point out an object or an area to create context and make the collaboration task clearer. This is mainly observed in a real-world situation where individuals use hand gestures to point something to another person during a conversation. It is a natural behavior that might also happen in an immersive environment but with more possibilities due to the extension of technology. A good example is the possibility of pointing and seeing occluded objects by creating a transparency area (transparency technique) or by cutting a region away (cutaway technique) using rays and pointers cues [AKK11]. [CLL21] studied another use of rays, where they compared the usability of pointing lines versus moving tracks techniques to point out objects before selecting them. Their results showed that pointing lines had a better performance and ease of control over motion tracks. Also, the interest zone identification can be facilitated by adjusting the user's finger direction in a virtual environment [SDM19]. This technique, called warping deixis, is useful for distant targets in which observers frequently misinterpret the target of a pointing gesture. Virtual volumes were also a visual cue used as spatial area volume [ZBZ23]. According to the study, they have contributed to a faster task performance time. Finally, a prototype created by [WZW20] allowed users to leave symbols in the form of a flare on the object's surface to indicate an interesting zone to other collaborators.",
